## In this, I have some models for training and testing on FashionMNIST dataset
FashionMNIST_1_Tutorial : Flatten image to vector and put it into a Neural Network which just have Linear and ReLU layers

- Accuracy on training_data: 91.08 %

- Accuracy on testing_data: ___

FashionMNIST_2_Tutorial : Using some kernel for extracting features from image by using Conv2d, ReLU and MaxPooling. Then Flatten features to a vector and feed-forward in a simple Linear-ReLU model

- Accuracy on training_data: 91.68 %

- Accuracy on testing_data: 86.44 %

### I hope I will create more model to improve accuracy on testing_data upto over 90%
